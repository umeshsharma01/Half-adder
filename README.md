# Half-adder
A Half Adder is a fundamental combinational digital circuit used to add two 1-bit binary numbers.
It has two inputs A and B and two outputs called Sum and Carry. 
The Sum output represents the least significant bit of the addition, while the Carry output represents the overflow bit generated when both inputs are high. 
The Half Adder operates based on simple logic: the Sum is produced using an XOR gate and the Carry is produced using an AND gate.
